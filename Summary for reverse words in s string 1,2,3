This post will include all 3 reverse words in a string question in leetcode, which are:
151. Reverse Words in a String
186. Reverse Words in a String II
557. Reverse Words in a String III

The general approach is

change string to a list. s = list(s) ind = len(s)
reverse whole list.
reverse each word in array.
To reverse, we create 2 function to reverse a whole list and reverse the each word in list.
def reverse_list(self, s, i, j):
        while i < j:
            s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
            i += 1
            j -= 1 
T: O(n/2) S: O(1)
def reverse_word(self, s, ind):
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i < ind:
			# This will skip any space that are in front of the word
            while i < j or (i < ind and s[i] == ' '):
                i += 1
			# This will find the position that word ends.
            while j < i or (j < ind and s[j] != ' '):
                j += 1
			# reverse list between i, j-1, which is the position of the word
            self.reverse(s, i, j-1)
T: O(nlogn) S: O(1)
By using above 2 functions, we can easily handle:
186. Reverse Words in a String II --- which string is already converted to a list, so no need for step1
557. Reverse Words in a String III --- which has no space and we can reverse it diretly.

Since there are spaces in string in 151. Reverse Words in a String, we can use another function to take care of the spaces.

    def remove_space(self, s, ind):
        i, j = 0, 0
        while j < ind:
			# skip all spaces before a word 
            while j < ind and s[j] == ' ':
                j += 1
			# put words in its right posistion
            while j < ind and s[j] != ' ':
                s[i] = s[j]
                i += 1
                j += 1
			# skip all spaces after a word
            while j < ind and s[j] == ' ':
                j += 1
			# if a word is done, we need to add a space at the end of it so we can keep the original format.
            if j < ind:
                s[i] = ' '
                i += 1
        return s[:i]
T: O(n) S: O(1)
So for 151. Reverse Words in a String: T: O(n+logn) S: O(1)
