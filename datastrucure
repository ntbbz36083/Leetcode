        Three things to maintain:
        
        1. a dict, named as `self._node`, for the reference of all nodes given key.
           That is, O(1) time to retrieve node given a key.
           
        2. Each frequency has a doubly linked list, store in `self._freq`, where key
           is the frequency, and value is an object of `DLinkedList`
        
        3. The min frequency through all nodes. We can maintain this in O(1) time, taking
           advantage of the fact that the frequency can only increment by 1. Use the following
		   two rules:
           
           Rule 1: Whenever we see the size of the DLinkedList of current min frequency is 0,
                   the min frequency must increment by 1.
           
           Rule 2: Whenever put in a new (key, value), the min frequency must 1 (the new node)

        The common point of these two cases is that:

        1. if the cache reaches its capacity, pop the least frequently used item. (*)

        3. add new node to the DLinkedList with frequency 1
